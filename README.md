# Content, Technically

Personal blog available at <a href="https://beccarobins.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://beccarobins.github.io/</a>. I write about content-related things, that is, not about writing content, but about the work that goes into it. My (infrequent) views are my own.

## Contributing

<!---
Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
