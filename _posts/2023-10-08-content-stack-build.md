Whoa whoa whoa. First staging and now the build? I thought this blog was about content. Well, just, it's about content. Technically. But it's also about the technical parts of content. And the (software) build is a crucial part of the stack. It converts all those files you created from a human-readable form into a computer-readable form, but it's all capable of much much more.
