This seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? But _you know_ how you know someone who somehow breaks everything? That person isn't unlucky. They just don't know what they're doing. Don't be them. Learn the tools in your toolbox and _keep learning_ them. You might break things as you go, but you'll also learn how to fix them.

While it's certainly beyond the scope of this post (and even this blog) for me to describe all the things you need to know about your tools, I can provide some tips on ways you can build your knowledge around your toolset. And here's some good news: you don't have to memorize everything, or anything really.

## Identify your stack



If you're struggling to identifying all the parts of your stack, 

## Understand the faults and have a workaround

Nothing is perfect. There is a very good chance that you'll want to do something with your tool that it can't do. Maybe you want to implement add a lightbox to an image, but your markup language doesn't support that&mdash;find an alternative method, such as providing an additional version of the image or a link to an enhanced image. Unless you're in a very new org, chances are someone has dealt with this situation before and has come up with a fix. Reach out. Just make sure that you _listen_ and take note of what they say.

There is a worse situation though, where your tool can't do something that _you think it can do_. I'll give a real example from my time at DataCamp. 

> I was working as a Content Developer in the summer, and a product team had recently formed around our authoring tool, Teach. Spell check is a surprisingly difficult technical problem, so for the time being, we were using the Grammarly extension. But unbeknownst to _all of us_, there was an incompatible element between our authoring tool and Grammarly (I don't remember what it was, sorry). However, on the surface, it _looked_ like it was working. Squiggly lines would appear, the correct spelling would show up in a hover tip, and clicking on the hover tip would show the corrected spelling within the editor. However, it turned out that clicking the correct spelling **only** showed it in the editor. The correction didn't actually save to the file. **And we didn't notice it for weeks**. The first time I noticed it was when I was proofreading a course I was about to launch and was correcting errors I remembered correcting before. Once we were all aware of this issue, we knew that we all had to use another method for spell checking until the issue was resolved.

## Build your resources

Perhaps you can document the 'gotchas' in your toolset and share that as an onboarding doc.

## Summary

Knowing your toolset is part of your craft. And knowing it well makes your job easier.
