## Understand the faults and have a workaround

Nothing is perfect. 

For example, this blog is written in GitHub. I've been working directly in the web-hosted repository (not in a locally cloned repo using a text editor) and spell checking is nonexistent. This makes sense because repos are mostly used to host code, not content. I've been using GitHub for content management for a number of years now and it's made me realize how dependent I am on those red squiggly lines you find in other text editors. I find A LOT of spelling errors when I read through my work. And I reread it and still find errors. But knowing that this is a limitation, means I can workaround it.
