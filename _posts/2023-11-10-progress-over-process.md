This post is actually pretty domain-agnostic, but it's something that has been bugging me for a while now. It's about _process_. And believe you me, I **love** process. Process brings structure, consistency, and cohesiveness. If you ask me to operationalize something, I'm going to be pumped! But BUT, if you focus so much on process that you're not _progressing_, you're doing it wrong.

## Process for the sake of process

People who I've worked with, might read this and say something like "kettle meet pot" due to my aforementioned love of process, but hear me out. Process implementation and improvements _must_ happen (at some point) in a mature organization. However, new processes should never be _more work_ than the previous process. Okay okay, but "I was doing just fine" you say. Sure. _You were_. BUT ad hoc processes are only as efficient as the least efficient process. This means if you have a scrappy little org where a _few_ people are making things work, then your team's utilization (and I mean this is in the official operations management way) actually reflects your _less_ efficient staff. In this case, update your damn process.

However, if you have a _relatively_ functioning process (that is, working but could use improvements), consider **not** reinventing the wheel, but rather focusing on pain points. And make sure you **know** your pain points rather than assume them. Too often parts of a workflow are interpreted as difficult, such as a technical task because they aren't being done, but oftentimes, your stakeholders don't even know that's what they're supposed to be doing. Maybe you can solve your problem with a one-pager rather than rewriting a script or reconfiguring an automation. Bringing _focus_ to your process improvements means that you (likely) won't slow down those who know what to do already while helping those who need it.

If you're spending most of your time _crafting_ your new process and little to no time _implementing_ it or at least testing out the implementation, you my friend are just doing process for the sake of process. And worse yet, if no one is calling you out on it, those "process improvements" you think are so important, _don't actually matter at all_.

### Signs you're doing too much process work

- You spend more time in meetings about a project than working on the project.
- You have the same conversation in every meeting.
- Your workflow requires a diagram just to explain it.
- Your workflow requires extensive onboarding and documentation.

## Summary

Process has its place and, when done correctly, can lead to improved products, content, working relationships, etc. However, when done poorly or just _all the freaking time_, you'll be more likely to piss off your coworkers than impress them.

And lastly, I sincerely apologize to all the engineers I've fought with over this. While I still think y'all could use more process, I now understand how you view my preferred amount of process and it certainly does seem wasteful. Can we at least agree on commenting your code?
