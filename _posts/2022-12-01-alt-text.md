# Alternative Text

## Do it

## Don't do it

### Keyword stuffing

For the love of Pete Sampras do **not** load your alt text up with keywords for SEO!

### Say too much

### Add it everywhere

This may surprise you (it did me), but not every image needs alt text. While many images contribute to your content, some images are just there to break up large blocks of text or to look pretty. In web accessibility, these images are called **decorative images** and they are treated different than say a chart that shows the results of a survey. Decorative images are actually _skipped_ by screenreaders. This allows the reader to maintain their focus on valuable content without being interrupted. For example, "Photograph of an amazing Tuscan sunset" being read out in the middle of a panzanella recipe (my favorite salad, btw).
