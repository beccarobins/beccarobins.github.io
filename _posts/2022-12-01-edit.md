Editing your content is like staying well hydrated water, your content needs it to perform. 

> Spelling mistakes are lazy mistakes.

I heard a guy say this on the subway once. And that man was right. With SO many tools out there and presumably _professional_ writers, how do we constantly run into such blatant errors? I've even seen spelling errors in Google's content&mdash;in H1 headers! I realize I'm going to put my foot in it and definitely have spelling errors on this site (probably in this article), but I'm going to do as much as I can to avoid that fate.
