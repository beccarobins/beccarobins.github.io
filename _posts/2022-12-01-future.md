title: Future proof your content

It's essential to maintain your content. Checking for errors, typos, and outdated elements helps your readers and makes your content better. While some things will inevitably require updating, there are things you can do to limit what parts of your work you need to maintain.


Thinking about your future content will help your future self, I promise.

Make your internal content future proof as well. Recently, I made some updates in the internal documentation for my department

# Things to avoid

- **Team names** If your team has a name that isn't "Content Team", an acronym for example, then don't use it in your content. It doesn't help anything and it _will_ change.
- **Job titles** Instead of using a job title, using a title that _describes_ your role. These may end up being the same, e.g., Senior Writer, but specific titles may be more confusing than helpful to your read. What exactly is a Technical Evangelist?
- **Current events** Mentioning things that either just happened or are happening soon (that are irrelevant to your content of course) do nothing but date your content. Is school starting soon? Unless you're writing about something related to school starting, it won't help your content stay fresh for long.
- **Pop culture** Specifically, niche pop culture. The GIF about something that happened in 2015 doesn't translate as well as you think it does. For example, I don't understand the following meme. At all.

<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}
#container {height: 50%; width:50%; font-size: 0;}
#left, #middle, #right {display: inline-block; *display: inline; zoom: 1; vertical-align: top; font-size: 12px;}
#left {width: 25%; margin-right: 10px; border-radius: 15px;}
#right {width: 70%; font-family:"helvetica"; margin-top: 5px; font-size: 18px;}
img {border-radius: 15px;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="container">
    <div id="middle">
      <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/030/157/womanyellingcat.jpg" alt="Woman yelling at a cat meme.">
</div>
</body>
</html>
