This often comes as a surprise to my engineering and data scientist friends, but GitHub is used by MANY organizations as a content management system. When I worked at DataCamp, GitHub was our CMS and our authoring tool was built on top of GitHub&mdash;every `CTRL + S` was a commit and pull requests and merges were all done in the tool. Each course was its own repository. At Microsoft, we have multiple content management systems, but it shouldn't be surprising that at least one of them moved over to GitHub after [Microsoft acquired them in 2018](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/). One of the platforms I worked on even has [public repositories that you can contribute to](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs).

Technically speaking, I'm using GitHub as a content management system for this blog. It's no where near as complex as the ones used by the organizations I've worked for since it's only one repository, but functionally speaking, it does the same things. Here, I'll go over some concepts, technology, and programming languages that you need to know to successfully navigate GitHub as a content management system. I've seen a lot of people try to skate by without this knowledge and it hasn't been pretty&mdash;don't be the person who makes your colleagues clean up your git-related messes.
