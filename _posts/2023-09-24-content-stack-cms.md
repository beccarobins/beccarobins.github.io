    The content stack - part 4: the CMS
published: false
---

We're continuing the content stack series by dipping our toe into the vast world of content management systems. **Content management systems** (also known as CMS) are _where_ content work happens. The CMS landscape is _vast_ and I do **not** recommend learning everything about all of them, but knowing their intents and purposes and some basic functionality will get you a long way.

## Content management systems

> A content management system (CMS) is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for technical knowledge. In other words, a CMS lets you build a website without needing to write code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).

### Content management application

### Content delivery application

### Dedicated content management systems

You've probably heard of a number of content management systems already. 

- WordPress
- Wix
- Squarespace


### Unconventional content management systems

If you're looking for a more flexible or maybe even scrappier approach, a dedicated CMS might be a bit too much&mdash;too much cost, too much overhead, etc. There are a number of software programs out there that, while they aren't intended to be used as a CMS, can be used as one (a prime example of technology appropriation by the way).

- **GitHub** - The content on this blog is _managed_ in GitHub, but it's just one repo, so it's more of a website builder. However, everything on <learn.microsoft.com>  and <datacamp.com> are managed using GitHub as a CMS.
- **Notion** - has documentation pages as well as the ability to publish pages to the web.

### Learning management systems

If you work in Learning & Development or education, your CMS is probably a _learning management system_ or LMS. Learning management systems are

- **Moodle**
- **Blackboard**

When I was an undergraduate back in the mid-2000s, I recall using an LMS called [ANGEL][ANGEL].
