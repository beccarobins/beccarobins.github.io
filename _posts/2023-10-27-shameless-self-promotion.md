## Why Becca?

- 6 years of experience as a (human) behavioral researcher
- 6 years of tech industry experience
    - At a startup and one of the largest tech corporations in the world

- Sought after for both her mentorship and thought leadership.

Here are some cool things she can do:
- Code
- Write
- Analyze data
- Run a meeting

## Why not Becca?

Why _shouldn't_ you hire Becca? You shouldn't hire Becca if you love endless discussions without decisions, are opaque about the state or your team or company, or you believe in waiting to ship products until they are perfect. **Becca's core values include a bias-to-action, transparency, and progress over perfection.** Becca loves getting scrappy when needed, but loves a tidy-up just as much.
