I thought putting a list of "basic" content vocab together might be helpful because this is the stuff you're expected to know on Day 1 of a new job&mdash;even if you're brand-spanking-new. And, while these are the things that **will actually help you do your job**, you'll _never_ find them in a company glossary.

**Authoring tool** - A program where your content is written, formatted, and is connected to your content management system. See [The content stack](../content-stack#authoringtool) for more information.

**Content management system** - 

**Editor** - Another term frequently used instead of "authoring tool". However, it's important to note that it might also refer to a text editor, such as Notepad, which is not _necessarily_ an authoring tool.

**Evergreen content** - 

**Information architecture** - 

**Learning management system** - 

**Metadata** - 

**Search engine optimization** - aka SEO.

**Sentence case** - 

**Text editor** - 

**Title case** - 

**WYSIWYG** - pronounced "wizzy wig".

<div class="alert-note">
    <span class="closebtn" onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none';">&times;</span> 
    <strong>Note:</strong> I will keep on updating this as I remember old things/learn new things.
