    The content stack - part 8: qualitative data
published: false
---

You may think of qualitative data as customer feedback, and sure that is a form of qualitative feedback, but 1) we've already talked about feedback and 2) there is a _wealth_ of qualitative data in your content that you are (potentially) not tapping into. A qualitative data analysis is a great way to gain a deeper understanding of your current content library and a starting point for directing content strategy.

## Your content as a data source


### Text mining

Your customer feedback might be funneled into it's own dashboard. 

### Regular expressions

I can't stress to you how often I use regular expressions. Or how much I still suck at them. 

## Summary

Next up, and the last part of our series, is [quantitative data](../coming-soon).
