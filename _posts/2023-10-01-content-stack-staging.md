    The content stack - part 5: staging

Staging? The term might make you think of parlour tricks employed by realtors or perhaps if you like the theater (like I do), you think of set designs and props. It's also an engineering term. You can think of it as a dress rehearsal for your content. You get to see what your site will look like when it's live and make any changes before opening night.

## Staging

So I said that staging is an engineering term, right? Well guess what baby&mdash;you're part engineer now! A content engineer of sorts
