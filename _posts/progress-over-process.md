# Progress over Process

This post is actually pretty domain agnostic, but it's something that has been bugging me for a while now. It's about _process_. And believe you me, I **love** process. Process brings structure, consistency, and cohesiveness. If you ask me to operationalize something, I'm going to be pumped! But BUT, if you focus so much on process that you're not progressing, you're doing it wrong.

## Process for the sake of process



And lastly, I sincerely apologize to all the engineers I've fought with over this. While I still think y'all could use more process, I now understand how you view my preferred amount of process and it certainly does seem wasteful. Can we at least agree on commenting your code?
