_Someone_ has _something_ to say about your content. Someone probably already has said something. And it's your job to listen to them. Well, sometimes.

Feedback is an integral part of content creation. Social media content creators boldly receive their feedback in the form of comments directly on their channels. Some of your content might have those comments as well. However, chances are that if you're working on content that has its own site, you probably have a separate and more discreet means of receiving customer feedback, one that doesn't expose your contents flaws so publicly.

## Find your feedback

I've seen many different customer feedback workflows both within and between the orgs I've worked in. I don't know where yours is. You might not either. If you don't go find it; it might hold treasure. I'm going to describe a few places where you _might_ find your customer feedback as well as a few advantages/disadvantages of those.

### Dashboards

Your customer feedback might be funneled into it's own dashboard. Dashboards are great because they bring all your feedback into one place and (usually) have filtering and sorting features that lets you focus on the content you're responsible for. But dashboards are only as good as they are created to be. And unfortunately for content folks, they are usually created by data scientists with **zero** experience in content. Sometimes you'll get lucky and content folks will be included when a new dashboard gets created, but don't bet on it. Some potential issues when it comes to feedback in dashboards:

- **Issue status** - Is the feedback current or did someone already implement this feedback? Who knows? Unless your feedback is being funneled in from a source that has some sort of interactivity, like a ticketing system, it's unlikely you'll be able to tell on a dashboard whether the feedback is still relevant.
- **Duplicates** - This is an issue everywhere, but it's harder to tell on a dashboard and like the issue status, there may be no means to mark a row as a duplicate.

<div class="alert-warning">
<span>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> A <i>potential</i> workaround for both of these issues is to export your data to a spreadsheet (if your BI tool allows it), add a status column, and maybe a duplicate column too. This is by no means the best solution though.
    <br><br>
    <strong>You'd have to do the same thing every week, month, or quarter</strong> and batch your work by date. Even worse, if you're taking on existing content and no one has touched the feedback for years (I've been there), then batching by date won't help much. You'll need to go through it ALL before that approach becomes sustainable. And this approach wil <strong>not</strong> at any point become scalable.

</div>

### Ticketing system

Your org might treat content feedback like customer support tickets.

### Within the authoring tool or CMS

You might need to look towards

## The internet is for trolls

**This is probably the most important section of this whole series.** You **will** find mean, nasty, hurtful comments about your content. Someone will swear. Someone will write a stream of conscious as their mind slowly unravels due to your horrible writing. Someone will tell you that you should be fired and that they could do your job better. (Some even give their email thinking you'll do it.)

I've seen _every single one of these_. And they aren't true.

Don't take these things personally. And if the sentiment that's coming across is just plain rude, don't take them seriously either. If someone drops a series of F-bombs about something, don't fix it because it made _one person_ mad. Use your best judgement and fix _real_ problems, not perceived ones.
