If you work in content, you probably spend an enormous amount of time either giving or receiving feedback. The best feedback helps evolve your content, while bad feedback leaves you saying "so, what is it you want me to do?" Writing good feedback isn’t the easiest, but fortunately 

I’ve had days where 90% of my time was spent building feedback docs

What I’ve learned during this time is that the best way to get feedback incorporated is through clarity.

## Burn the sandwich

You’ve probably heard of the feedback sandwich—where you provide a piece of critical feedback by "sandwiching" it between two compliments. This is meant to soften the blow of the criticism. 

Using the feedback sandwich is especially bad for newbies. Individuals who are early in their career (obviously) have less practice giving feedback, which often means less clear feedback. When surrounded by compliments, this less clear feedback is completely washed away. The feedback recipient usually takes this as a 

## My personal method

I've slowly been building up the following method of providing feedback over the last five years. It works best when you're a subject matter expert (SME) in the area you're reviewing (steps 3 & 4 can be difficult without expertise), but 

### Step 1 - Provide  absolute clarity

Give _crystal clear_ feedback. Be specific. Be candid. You don't need to be insulting to do either of those things, I promise. The goal is to ensure your author has zero confusion about the issue.

### Step 2 - Justify your critique

Why are you giving this feedback? Is it an issue of content guidelines? Is their clarity an issue? Understanding where your critique comes from will give your author a better idea of how to fix it. Better yet, it could help prevent future issues.

### Step 3 - Lead by example

What could be an alternative way to do this? If you have a clear example that further demonstrates your point, use it. However, be careful with this one. If you're working with less experienced writers, you might end up providing examples again and again&mdash;essentially writing for them. Sometimes a better approach is to show an analogous example.

### Step 4 - Show the effect

Why would that alternative be better? Build on your example by examining _why_ it improves the work.

## Other helpful methods

### Emojis

If you have _a lot_ of feedback to provide, justifying it and providing examples can be pretty cumbersome, and frankly overkill. Using emojis (along with a key) can provide the clarity you need. 

### Canned feedback

If you review a lot of the same type of content, you probably provide a lot of the same feedback. It can be frustrating to write and rewrite the same thing over and over. Having a standing
